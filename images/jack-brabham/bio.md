Jack Brabham (b. April 2, 1926, Hurstville, Australia) was F1's ultimate grease-monkey genius – a hard-nosed mechanic who bullied his way to three World Championships (1959, 1960, 1966) and became the only driver to win a title in his own car. Nicknamed "Black Jack" for his oil-stained hands and ruthless pragmatism, this Sydney garage mechanic turned the sport upside down by proving rear-engine cars could dominate.

Brabham raced with a spanner in his cockpit and fuel economy in his blood – his 1959 U.S. Grand Prix victory saw him push his out-of-gas Cooper across the finish line to clinch his first title. While rivals obsessed over speed, Brabham out-thought them, pioneering radical innovations like in-race refueling and building the Brabham team into a championship-winning force.

His 1966 crown – won at age 40 in the Brabham BT19 he designed himself – remains the ultimate DIY triumph in motorsport history. The ultimate racer-constructor, Brabham retired as the sport's elder statesman, having mentored a generation of engineers while never losing his working-class edge. When asked his secret, he growled: "Other drivers race the car. I make the car race for me."
