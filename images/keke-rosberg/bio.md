Keke Rosberg (b. December 6, 1948, Stockholm, Sweden) was F1's original "Nordic Nightmare" – a chain-smoking, mustachioed maverick who stole the 1982 World Championship with sheer audacity, winning just 1 race all season. Nicknamed "The Flying Finn" (before Hakkinen/Räikkönen claimed the title), Rosberg embodied the sport's last true cowboy era, racing with his visor taped open and a cigarette dangling from his lips during pit stops.

Rosberg's title was a masterclass in consistency – his Williams FW08 was slower than Renault's turbo rockets, but he bullied it to five podiums while rivals melted engines or crashed. The season's shocker came at Monaco, where he won by 42 seconds in pouring rain, later admitting: "I couldn't see a damn thing – just memorized the puddles." Off-track, the man who partied with James Hunt perfected the art of psychological warfare, once faking engine trouble in practice to lure rivals into complacency.

The father of 2016 champion Nico, Keke retired abruptly in 1986 after a fiery crash at Adelaide – but not before pioneering the "Rosberg Rocket" start (his clutchless launches left rivals standing still). His legacy? Proof that raw courage and racecraft could outgun technology.
