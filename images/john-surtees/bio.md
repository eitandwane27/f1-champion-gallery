John Surtees (b. February 11, 1934, Tatsfield, England) was motorsport's ultimate ironman – the only world champion on both two wheels and four, a brooding genius who conquered Grand Prix motorcycles before storming Formula 1. Nicknamed "Big John" for his towering physique and relentless work ethic, this former garage apprentice brutalized the competition with a rare blend of mechanical empathy and raw courage.

Surtees rewrote the rules in 1964, dragging an underpowered Ferrari to the F1 title just five years after claiming his final 500cc motorcycle crown – a feat as improbable as it was unprecedented. His victory at the Nürburgring that year (winning by over two minutes in torrential rain) became legend, proving the man who'd dominated the Isle of Man TT could tame F1's deadliest circuit with equal ferocity.

Behind the steely gaze hid a perfectionist who'd spend nights disassembling engines himself – a habit from his days tuning Vincent motorcycles. His career ended in a 1972 Can-Am crash that left him clinically dead for minutes, but "Il Grande John" walked away, later forming his own F1 team. The man Enzo Ferrari called "my finest warrior" died in 2017, his legacy standing as motorsport's ultimate crossover king.
