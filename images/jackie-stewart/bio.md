Jackie Stewart (b. June 11, 1939, Milton, Scotland) was Formula 1's original "Flying Scot" – a tartan-clad trailblazer who won three World Championships (1969, 1971, 1973) while revolutionizing the sport's safety standards. Nicknamed "The Wee Scot" for his diminutive stature and "The Tartan Tornado" for his relentless speed, Stewart combined matador-like car control with a crusader's conscience, surviving the sport's deadliest era to become its most eloquent reformer.

Stewart's genius lay in his mathematical precision – he approached circuits like algebraic equations, pioneering the art of smooth, calculated aggression. His 1968 German GP victory at the Nürburgring (winning by over four minutes in fog and rain) remains the greatest wet-weather masterclass in history. Yet behind the trademark sideburns and Rolex watches hid a man traumatized by witnessing 57 deaths, who fought team principals and governments to introduce seatbelts, crash barriers, and medical centers.

The original "brand ambassador" who brought corporate professionalism to F1, Stewart retired abruptly at 34 after winning his third title – walking away to build a business empire and mentor a generation of drivers. His legacy? Over 50 safety improvements credited to his crusade, and a simple motto: "Winning is meaningless if you don't survive to enjoy it."
