Nigel Mansell (b. August 8, 1953, Upton-upon-Severn, England) was F1’s ultimate "Lionheart" – a mustachioed gladiator who fought his way to the 1992 World Championship through sheer force of will, leaving broken cars and broken rivals in his wake. Nicknamed "Il Leone" (The Lion) by Italian fans and "Our Nige" by the British press, Mansell became the sport’s most beloved underdog-turned-champion, famous for his overtaking lunges, mechanical sympathy (he once finished 2nd with a failing gearbox for 40 laps), and post-race collapses from exhaustion.

His 1992 season with Williams-Renault was pure domination – 9 wins from 16 races, including five straight victories to open the year in the active-suspension FW14B, a car he called "so good it felt like cheating." The man who began his career selling his house to fund his racing became Britain’s first champion in 16 years, celebrated by fans who stormed the Silverstone track after his final win there.

Mansell’s career was a rollercoaster – from his brutal Ferrari feud with Alain Prost (1989-90) to his last-lap IndyCar title (1993), he never did things the easy way. Even in retirement, the driver who famously said "I’m here to race, not to finish" kept pushing – now running a boutique car dealership and mentoring young British talent.
