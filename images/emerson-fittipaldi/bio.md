Emerson Fittipaldi (b. December 12, 1946, São Paulo, Brazil) was the original "Boy Wonder" of Formula 1 – a baby-faced assassin who became the sport's youngest World Champion at 25 (1972) and ignited Brazil's racing revolution. Nicknamed "Emmo" and "The São Paulo Sphinx" for his unshakable calm, this coffee heir turned garage mechanic dominated with a rare blend of Latin flair and ice-cool precision.

Fittipaldi's rise was meteoric: after sleeping on a Lotus factory floor to learn engineering, he won his fifth-ever F1 start in 1970. His 1972 championship season with Lotus (five wins from 11 races) showcased genius-level tire conservation, while his 1974 title with McLaren (defeating Ferrari's Niki Lauda) proved he could win with pure racecraft. The first driver to popularize the "late apex" cornering technique, Emmo made smoothness lethal – his rivals joked he could "win a Grand Prix without wrinkling his overalls."

At 31, he shocked F1 by walking away to resurrect his brother's failed Copersucar team, then conquered IndyCar (two Indy 500 wins) while wearing his trademark orange juice sponsor patches. The man who once said "racing is art with machinery" remains Brazil's godfather of speed.
