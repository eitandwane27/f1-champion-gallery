Lewis Hamilton (b. January 7, 1985, Stevenage, England) is F1’s record-shattering titan, a seven-time World Champion whose meteoric rise from council estate kid to global icon rewrote motorsport’s rulebook. Nicknamed "The Hammer" for his relentless dominance, he holds more wins (103), poles (104), and podiums (197) than any driver in history.

The only Black driver in F1’s 70+ year history, Hamilton exploded onto the scene in 2007—nearly winning the title as a rookie—before claiming his first championship with McLaren in 2008’s rain-soaked Brazilian GP finale. His 2013 move to Mercedes ignited the sport’s most dominant era: six titles in seven years (2014-2020), powered by hybrid-engine mastery and psychological warfare that broke rivals.

Beyond statistics, Hamilton revolutionized F1’s culture—pushing for diversity through Mission 44, launching the Hamilton Commission, and using his platform for activism. His 2021 duel with Verstappen (ending in controversial Abu Dhabi drama) and subsequent competitive resurgence prove the 39-year-old still fights like a rookie hungry for glory.
