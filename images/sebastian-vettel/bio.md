Sebastian Vettel (b. July 3, 1987, Heppenheim, Germany) was Formula 1's "Rainbow Warrior" - a four-time World Champion (2010-2013) who evolved from Red Bull's cocky young gun to the sport's moral conscience. Nicknamed "Baby Schumi" in his early years and later "The Professor" for his technical genius, Vettel's career was a study in contradictions: a driver who could execute flawless pole laps (like his legendary 2017 Singapore "Holy Lap") one moment, then stage sit-ins for LGBTQ+ rights the next.

Vettel's Red Bull reign redefined dominance - his 2013 season (9 consecutive wins, 13 victories total) with the RB9's blown diffuser remains one of F1's most crushing performances. The man who kept a lucky penny in his racing suit and sang "Blueberry Hill" before races combined obsessive preparation with raw talent, holding off Alonso and Webber in era-defining duels.

His Ferrari years (2015-2020) saw him trade cheeky grins for gravitas, nearly dethroning Mercedes in 2017-18 while becoming F1's unofficial spokesman on sustainability and human rights. The driver who once said "I'm here to race, not to smile"* retired in 2022 as the sport's conscience - still fast enough for podiums, but too principled to ignore bigger battles.
