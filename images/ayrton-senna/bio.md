Ayrton Senna (b. March 21, 1960, São Paulo, Brazil) was "The Rain Master" – a sorcerer of the spray who turned monsoons into masterclasses, his yellow helmet slicing through downpours like lightning. From his 1984 Monaco debut (nearly winning in a backmarker Toleman) to his 1993 Donington Park victory (gaining 5 positions in 1 lap), Senna treated wet tracks as his canvas, blending brutality and finesse in ways that defied physics.

His 1988 season with McLaren was pure domination – 8 wins from 16 races, including a 1-minute victory margin at Monaco (a record he later called "too much, even for me"). The man who prayed before races and wept after crashes treated his car like a divine instrument, famously telling engineers: "I don’t drive the car. I talk to it, and it answers."

Senna’s rivalry with Alain Prost became F1’s defining drama – their 1989 Suzuka collision (and Senna’s disqualification) birthed his vengeful 1990 title, won via first-corner payback at the same circuit. His final act at Williams in 1994, struggling to tame the unstable FW16, ended tragically at Imola – a death that transformed F1 safety forever. The man who said "if you no longer go for a gap, you’re no longer a racing driver"* left behind a legacy of passion that still burns in every driver’s mirrors.
