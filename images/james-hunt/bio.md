James Hunt (b. August 29, 1947, Belmont, England) was Formula 1's ultimate "Golden Boy" – a tousled-haired, champagne-swirling rebel who stole the 1976 World Championship in a season so dramatic it inspired Rush. Nicknamed "Hunt the Shunt" for his early crash-prone days and later "The Great Shagger" for his off-track escapades, this Wimbledon tennis coach turned racer embodied F1's rock-star era with a lethal mix of raw talent and reckless charm.

Hunt's 1976 title duel with Niki Lauda became motorsport's greatest soap opera – his epic Hail Mary drive at Fuji (winning in monsoon conditions while Lauda parked his car) clinched the crown by a single point. Behind the playboy image (he once arrived hungover at Monaco and won by 30 seconds) hid a tactical genius who could "drive around problems" in machinery others deemed undrivable, like his infamous Hesketh 308 "garage band" car that humiliated factory teams.

Retiring abruptly at 32 after one final podium in the rain, Hunt traded his racing overalls for a BBC microphone, where his brutally honest commentary made him a fan favorite until his fatal heart attack at 45. His legacy? Proof that brilliance and chaos could coexist – summed up by his own motto: "Sex is breakfast. Racing is lunch. Death is dinner."
