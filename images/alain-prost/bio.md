Alain Prost (b. February 24, 1955, Lorette, France) was F1's ultimate "Calculating Assassin" – a bespectacled tactician who dissected races with mathematical precision to claim four World Championships (1985, 1986, 1989, 1993). Nicknamed "Le Professeur" for his methodical approach and "The Computer" for his data-driven ruthlessness, Prost mastered the art of winning at 95% while rivals pushed to 110%, living by his motto: "The perfect race is won by the smallest possible margin."

Prost's genius peaked in 1986 – his McLaren MP4/2C was slower than Williams' dominant Honda turbos, yet he stole the title by capitalizing on Nigel Mansell's explosive tire failure in Adelaide. The man who kept handwritten notebooks of every competitor's tire wear and fuel consumption turned races into chess matches, like his infamous 1983 French GP victory where he won by 22 seconds while lifting early to conserve fuel.

The architect of F1's most venomous rivalry, Prost's 1989 Suzuka clash with Ayrton Senna (and subsequent title) cemented his reputation as the sport's ultimate pragmatist. Even in retirement, his fingerprints remained: returning in 1993 to dominate with Williams-Renault (7 wins) while mentoring a young Michael Schumacher. The driver who hated being called "conservative" (preferring "efficient") proved brains could brutalize speed.
