Denny Hulme (b. June 18, 1936, Nelson, New Zealand) was motorsport's ultimate no-nonsense hardman – a chainsmoking, swear-hurling bulldozer who bullied his way to the 1967 Formula 1 World Championship with a broken hand and zero pretense. Nicknamed "The Bear" for his gruff demeanor and brute strength behind the wheel, this former onion farmer became the only Kiwi champion by embodying one philosophy: "Drive it like you stole it."

Hulme's title season was pure antipodean grit – he won two races while nursing third-degree burns from a fiery Can-Am crash, his blistered hands wrapped in bandages beneath his gloves. Driving Brabham's underpowered Repco V8 like a man possessed, he out-muscled flashier rivals through sheer consistency, racking up podiums while they broke down or crashed. His victory at Monaco that year (a track he loathed) proved even Hulme's "worst circuits" became hunting grounds.

Off-track, the Marlboro-smoking mechanic's mechanic kept it real – refusing sponsorship deals that required shaving his beard, and famously telling journalists: "If you want pretty, go watch ballet." Hulme's 1992 fatal heart attack during the Bathurst 1000, aged 56, saw him die as he lived: helmet on, racing boots laced, and giving zero damn about what anyone thought.
