Jenson Button (b. January 19, 1980, Frome, England) was F1’s ultimate "Smooth Operator" – a laid-back, surf-loving playboy who transformed into a ruthless tactician to claim the 2009 World Championship in one of the sport’s greatest underdog stories. Nicknamed "JB" and "The Sunshine Bandit" for his California-cool demeanor and golden-boy grin, Button mastered the art of "silky-smooth" tire management, coaxing speed from fragile rubber when others shredded theirs.

His 2009 title with Brawn GP was pure Hollywood – a team that nearly went bankrupt in preseason (after Honda’s withdrawal) dominated with a double-diffuser trick, while Button won 6 of the first 7 races. The man who partied with Paris Hilton and dated supermodels suddenly became a rain-soaked warrior, clinching the crown at Brazil by threading through lap-one chaos while rivals crashed.

Post-title, Button evolved into F1’s "Professor of Setup", mentoring younger drivers and outthinking rivals in mixed conditions (his 2011 Canadian GP win took 4 hours, with 6 pit stops and 30 overtakes). The driver who once said "I’m fast because I’m relaxed" retired in 2017 as Britain’s most versatile champion – now a TV pundit and extreme sports addict who surfs volcanoes.
