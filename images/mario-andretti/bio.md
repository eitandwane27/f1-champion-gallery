Mario Andretti (b. February 28, 1940, Montona, Italy) is motorsport's ultimate immigrant success story – a petrol-soaked phenom who conquered Formula 1, IndyCar, NASCAR, and endurance racing with a ferocity that made him America's most versatile champion. Nicknamed "Mr. Versatility" for his unprecedented range, this Italian refugee turned Pennsylvania steelworker became the last driver to win F1's World Championship (1978) and the Indy 500 (1969) while terrorizing rivals in everything from dirt ovals to Le Mans.

Andretti's 1978 Lotus 79 "ground effect" car rewrote F1 physics – his six wins that season (including a dominant victory at his home Dutch GP) showcased a driver so precise, engineers used his telemetry as a baseline. The same man who famously said "if everything seems under control, you're not going fast enough" could switch from F1's technical circuits to IndyCar's brutal ovals within days, winning the 1967 Daytona 500 stock car race just for fun.

Even at 53, Andretti was still qualifying on pole at Le Mans and winning CART races against drivers half his age. The patriarch of racing's royal family (son Michael, grandson Marco), his trademark white-and-red helmet remains the symbol of immigrant grit – a kid who arrived in America with nothing but a dream and left with every trophy that mattered.
