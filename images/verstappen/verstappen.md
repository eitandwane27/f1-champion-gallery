Max Verstappen (b. September 30, 1997, Hasselt, Belgium) is a Dutch racing phenom who rewrote F1’s record books. Nicknamed "The Flying Dutchman," he became the youngest driver in F1 history (17 years, 166 days) and stormed to his first victory at 18 with Red Bull in 2016—a debut performance so explosive it forced the sport to raise its age limit.

The son of F1 veteran Jos Verstappen, Max’s killer instinct was honed in karting before he bulldozed through junior series. His aggressive yet precise driving—marked by daring overtakes and wet-weather mastery—catapulted him into a rivalry with Lewis Hamilton, climaxing in a controversial 2021 title win on the final lap in Abu Dhabi.

Since then, Verstappen has dominated the hybrid era, securing back-to-back championships in 2022 and 2023 with record-breaking win streaks. Now a triple world champion, he embodies Red Bull’s technical brilliance with a ruthless efficiency that leaves rivals scrambling.
