Nelson Piquet (b. August 17, 1952, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) was Formula 1’s original "Professor of Provocation" – a brash, trash-talking genius who won three World Championships (1981, 1983, 1987) with a lethal mix of technical brilliance and psychological warfare. Nicknamed "The Rat" (for his sharp features and cunning racecraft) and "Nelsinho" (to distinguish him from his racing son), this former tennis prodigy turned garage mechanic rewrote the rules of mind games, once admitting: "I don’t break the rules—I stretch them until they scream."

Piquet’s 1981 title with Brabham (snatched from Carlos Reutemann by a single point) showcased his mastery of tire conservation, while his 1983 crown—won in Gordon Murray’s turbocharged "fan car" BT52—proved he could outthink engineers as well as rivals. His bitter 1987 feud with Williams teammate Nigel Mansell ("He’s an uneducated blockhead with a stupid mustache") became F1’s most explosive rivalry, climaxing with Piquet’s Honda-powered destruction of Mansell’s title hopes.

The first champion to use computer data analysis, Piquet retired in 1991 after a horrific IndyCar crash left him with legs "held together by screws." The man who famously said "nice guys finish second" now runs an environmental empire—proving even F1’s most ruthless predator could go green.
