Jacques Villeneuve (b. April 9, 1971, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Canada) was F1's last true "Rockstar Racer" – a bleach-blonde, earring-wearing maverick who stormed to the 1997 World Championship with a rebellious flair unseen since James Hunt. Nicknamed "JV" and "The Wild Canuck", Villeneuve combined fearless overtaking (his 130R flat-out passes at Suzuka became legend) with technical brilliance, becoming the only driver to win Indy 500, CART title, and F1 crown.

His 1997 title duel with Michael Schumacher peaked at Jerez, where he clinched the championship by ramming Schumacher off-track after the German tried to take him out. The son of Ferrari legend Gilles Villeneuve drove with the same flamboyance – his 1996 Williams FW18 took 11 poles (a rookie record), while his 1997 European GP victory in torrential rain proved his raw talent.

Post-F1, Villeneuve became a cult figure – racing Le Mans prototypes, releasing synth-pop albums, and calling out modern F1's politics with unfiltered honesty. His legacy? The man who said "If you're not crashing, you're not pushing hard enough" remains the last champion to win with no driver aids – pure mechanical grip and brass nerves.
