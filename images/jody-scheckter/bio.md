Jody Scheckter (b. January 29, 1950, East London, South Africa) was Formula 1’s original "Fast Farmer" – a hard-charging, no-nonsense competitor who became the only African World Champion (1979) while balancing his career with a sprawling farm in England. Nicknamed "The Flying Springbok" for his aggressive, elbows-out style, Scheckter rose to fame in the brutal 1970s era, surviving fiery crashes and political storms to claim Ferrari’s last drivers’ title for 21 years.

Scheckter’s career was defined by contradictions: the same driver who triggered the 1973 British GP pile-up (earning him a temporary ban) later mastered racecraft so precise he won the 1979 title without a single fastest lap. His 1978 victory at Watkins Glen—where he held off teammate Gilles Villeneuve’s relentless attacks—showcased steel nerves, while his 1979 season with Ferrari (three wins, six podiums) proved his ability to tame the tempestuous 312 T4 while rivals like Alan Jones faltered.

At 30, Scheckter shocked F1 by retiring at his peak, returning to his Laverstoke Farm to produce organic buffalo mozzarella. The man who once said "racing is about survival, not just speed" left the sport as he entered it—on his own terms.
