Kimi Räikkönen (b. October 17, 1979, Espoo, Finland) was Formula 1's "Iceman" – a monosyllabic, steely-eyed assassin who won the 2007 World Championship with Ferrari while embodying the sport's ultimate "less talk, more action" ethos. Nicknamed for his emotionless demeanor under pressure (and love of ice baths), Räikkönen became F1's last true "driver's driver" – a no-nonsense throwback who partied as hard as he raced and gave zero interviews unless absolutely necessary.

His 2007 title was pure cinematic drama – winning the final two races (China and Brazil) to steal the crown from Lewis Hamilton by 1 point, despite Ferrari favoring teammate Felipe Massa all season. The man who once radioed "Leave me alone, I know what I'm doing" during a race drove with supernatural car control, most famously at Suzuka 2005 (17 overtakes in one race) and Spa 2009 (winning in a Ferrari that hadn't podiumed all year).

Off-track, Räikkönen was F1's ultimate anti-hero – falling asleep in press conferences, wearing flip-flops on the podium, and celebrating his title by getting lost on a yacht in Finland. His 2021 retirement ended an era: the last driver who truly didn't give a damn about PR, only speed.
