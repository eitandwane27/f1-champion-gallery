Graham Hill (b. February 15, 1929, London, England) was Formula 1's ultimate raconteur and the only driver to win the Triple Crown of Motorsport – a champagne-swilling, mustachioed maverick who claimed two World Championships (1962, 1968) with a combination of tactical brilliance and sheer force of personality. Nicknamed "Mr. Monaco" for his record five wins on the streets of Monte Carlo, this former boatyard mechanic turned himself into racing's most sophisticated playboy through sheer willpower.

Hill raced with a debonair ruthlessness – his trademark blue helmet and overlapping driving gloves becoming symbols of an era when drivers danced with death at 180 mph while smoking between sessions. His 1968 title victory with Lotus, achieved while nursing broken ribs from a testing crash, epitomized his bulldog tenacity. The same man who partied with Rat Pack stars in Monaco casinos would spend hours polishing his car's suspension with a toothbrush.

Tragedy marked his final act: a 1975 plane crash claimed Hill at 46, just as he was mentoring his son Damon into motorsport. Yet his legacy endured as the sport's ultimate Renaissance man – a champion who won the Indy 500, Le Mans, and F1 title while forever embodying racing's golden rule: "You don't have to be mad to do this, but it helps."
